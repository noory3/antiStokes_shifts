# Overview 
To shift or not to shift: dynamics of amino acid preferences under stability-constrained evolution. Noor Youssed, Ed Susko, Andrew Roger, and Joseph Bielawski. 

# Organization 
- ./data/ contains all the data required to reproduce the figures and results presented in the manuscript
- ./output/ contains a few example site-specific (fitness, deltaG, frequency) landscapes from our simulations. Data from all sites observed in our simulations are too large to include in this repository, but are available upon request (please email n.youssef@dal.ca) 
- ./scripts/ contains scripts for analyses and to reproduce all figures
